CMPUT,101,Introduction to Computing,"[fundamental, algorithms, logic, number systems, circuits]","An introduction to fundamental concepts in computation, including state, abstraction, generalization, and representation. Introduction to algorithms, logic, number systems, circuits, and other topics in elementary computing science.",,,F&W,None,None,,
CMPUT,174,Introduction to the Foundations of Computation I,"[introduction to python, simple game development, data structures, recursion, syntax]","CMPUT 174 and 175 use a problem-driven approach to introduce the fundamental ideas of Computing Science. Emphasis is on the underlying process behind the solution, independent of programming language or style. Basic notions of state, control flow, data structures, recursion, modularization, and testing are introduced through solving simple problems in a variety of domains such as text analysis, map navigation, game search, simulation, and cryptography. Students learn to program by reading and modifying existing programs as well as writing new ones. No prior programming experience is necessary. Prerequisite: Math 30 or 30-1. See Note (1) above. Credit cannot be obtained for CMPUT 174 if credit has already been obtained for CMPUT 274 or 275, except with permission of the Department.",,,F&W,,,,
CMPUT,175,Introduction to the Foundations of Computation II,"[algorithms, data structures, objects, functional programming, time and memory consumption, user interface]","A continuation of CMPUT 174, revisiting topics of greater depth and complexity. More sophisticated notions such as objects, functional programming, time and memory consumption, and user interface building are explored. Upon completion of this two course sequence, students from any discipline should be able to build programs to solve basic problems in their area, and will be prepared to take more advanced Computing Science courses. Prerequisite: CMPUT 174 or SCI 100. Credit cannot be obtained for CMPUT 175 if credit has been obtained for CMPUT 275, except with permission of the Department.",CMPUT 174 or SCI 100,,F&W,,,,
